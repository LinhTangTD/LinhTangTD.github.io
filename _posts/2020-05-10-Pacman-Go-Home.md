During this pandemic time, people need to learn how to protect themselves from coronavirus. The key is to stay home, wear masks while going out, and avoid contacting infected people. PacmanGoHome is an educational game, based on the original Pacman game tutorial from [Zetcode](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/pacman/). The purpose of this game is to deliver this message to the players. We hope people can learn while playing PacmanGoHome.

The game is developed in Java by [Linh Tang](https://github.com/LinhTangTD) and [Yolanda Jiang](https://github.com/yolandajhzm) as the final project for `CSC207: Object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms` class at [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/) during Spring 2020.

## How to play?
Users can control Pacman with their 4 cursors keys to avoid viruses and try to reach home. There are three initial lives. In the maze, there are one mask and hospital, each can save Pacman one life. There is also an infected Pacman, having contact with him or virus costs Pacman one life. The game has two levels. The second level is more challenging as the number of viruses is double and moving faster, representing the real-time unexpectedly fast and widespread waves of COVID-19.
