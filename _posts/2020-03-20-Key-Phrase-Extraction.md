# Key Phrase Extraction

Automatic keyword extraction is an important research topic. Keywords serve as a dense summary for a document, lead to improved information retrieval, or be the entrance to a document collection. The aim of this project is to find a small set of terms that describes a specific document, independently of the domain it belongs to. 

âž¤ [Github Repo](https://github.com/LinhTangTD/KeyPhraseExtraction).  

### Models
We examine five different models: `n-grams` (unigram, bigram, trigram), `POSTagger-based-ngrams` (terms matching any of a set of part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences), and `RAKE` (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction). 

For the models using ngrams, we use three different features: term frequency, collection frequency and relative position of the first occurrence to find top keywords. 

### Installation & Usage
To run our model, download/clone this repo into your local device, compile & execute `KeyPhraseExtraction.java` in your IDE or through command-line tools (javac, java). Unzip the `TRAINING.zip` to get training data. 

Files ending with `.abstr` are used to train our models, while `.contr` documents contains the controlled manually assigned keywords, separated with semicolon and `.uncontr` contains the uncontrolled manually assigned keywords, separated with semicolon. 

For POSTagger model, please download the basic [English Stanford Tagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml) and add `.jar` files to your project build path or class path. 

### Testing & Evaluation
To evaluate the performance, we compute the precision score of the top 5 keywords generated for each document in the Training Dataset and compare among 5 models. 

The result is presented in the `report.txt` file. The standard used to calculate precision score of each `.abstr` document is the manually-picked keywords stored in the corresponding `.uncontr` files.
