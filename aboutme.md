<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
I started learning how to code since my second semester in college. I love developing software and apps that can come in handy. I'm comfortable with different languages such as <strong> Java, Python, C/C++, R </strong> across multiple platforms like <strong>macOS or Linux</strong>. Check out the <strong>Apps</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong> tabs at the top of the page to see some of my product.

<span class="fa fa-book about-icon"></span>
Last summer, I was awarded a research grant from Grinnell College to conduct summer research on Recommender Systems. My project focused on <strong>recommending music artists for Twitter users</strong>. It was presented at <a target="_blank" href= "https://ccscmw2019.aiello.io">Consortium for Computing Sciences in College Midwest</a> and won the <strong>First Prize</strong> in Student Poster Showcase. The paper has recently been accepted as short papers at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flairs-33.info/home">33rd International FLAIRS (Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society) Conference</a> and will be published in the proceedings with AAAI Press in upcoming weeks.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I'm a goal-oriented, data-driven programmer that values collaboration, flexibility and creativity. I enjoy working in a diverse, self-motivated and strong-willed environment with a steep learning curve and open-minded attitude. I consider myself a good team player but I also enjoy taking initiatives and leadership.
