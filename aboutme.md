Hi again, my name is <strong>Linh Tang</strong>. I come from Hanoi, Vietnam. I'm a rising junior majoring in <strong>Computer Science & Economics </strong> from <strong>Grinnell College</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Statistics</strong>. I graduated from Chinese-English class of Hanoi-Amsterdam High School for the Gifted in 2018.

During high school, I found and managed <a target="_blank" href= "https://traihekhoahoc.org"> Science Camp Hanoi </a>, the first youth-run, week-long camp in the city that focuses solely on science activities for primary & secondary school students. The camp has been hosted annually since summer 2017, attracting 140 kids all over the countries. I was the director (and web developer) of the camp for the first two seasons before entering college, and has been acting as the counselor for the management board since then.

I started learning how to code since 2019, my second semester in college. I love developing software and apps that can come in handy. I'm comfortable with different languages such as <strong> Java, Python, C/C++, R </strong> across multiple platforms <strong>macOS, Linux</strong>). Check out the <strong>Apps</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong> tabs at the top of the page to see some of my products.

In Summer 2019, I was awarded a research grant from Grinnell College to work at Recommender Systems Lab supervised by professor Fahmida Hamid. My project focused on <strong>recommending music artists for Twitter users</strong>. It was presented at <a target="_blank" href= "https://ccscmw2019.aiello.io">Consortium for Computing Sciences in College Midwest</a> and won the <strong>First Prize</strong> in Student Poster Showcase. The paper has recently been accepted as short papers at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flairs-33.info/home">33rd International FLAIRS</a> (Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society) Conference and will be published in the proceedings with AAAI Press in upcoming weeks.

For Summer 2020, I will be an Engineering Intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vinai.io/"> VinAI Research</a>, the top AI research lab in Vietnam. I am also awarded a research grant to work on statistics education project Stat2Lab this summer, a NSF program led by professor Shonda Kuiper at Grinnell College. I will be responsible for developing new educational games on Unity that enables students to apply statistical analysis into playing strategy. Recently, I was admitted to Goldman Sachs 2020 Engineering Essentials and will be attending this program in June.
